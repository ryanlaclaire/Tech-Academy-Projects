# Live Project

My final project at the Tech Academy, was two part. I first stepped into an existing project that was ongoing with a team already working on it. My first hurdle to overcome was to familiarize myself with the entire project and get a feel for what was going on. Once I did that, I quickly jumped in. As the bulk of code writing was already in place, I primarily worked on page layouts, tweaking placement of buttons, rows, columns and making sure everything worked on a responsive level.

The second phase of the project involved starting a new project from scratch. I truly enjoyed this as I got to really dive in to the MVC app building and really create something from scratch. We were taking a code first approach and I was able to create some models as well as some controllers and thus view accordingly. I also did some basic layout with CSS to get images in place and to tweak the navigation for all of the pages. 

During this live project I realized just how much I enjoyed coding and being able to create a program that is beneficial to others. It also helped me see just how many ways there are to help with software. Not just in making something with a nice UI, but by creating something that can solve real world problems.

I've included screen shots of some of the various problems I faced during the live project and also the solutions I achieved for those problems. Please feel free to take a look.
