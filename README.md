# Tech-Academy-Projects

Overview:

In 2018 I studied at The Tech Academy, a software development boot camp and licensed career school in Portland, Oregon. During the program I worked on several projects of varying scales to build my skills in HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, C#, and the .NET framework.There were many projects I worked on during this time which taught me a lot of valuable programming skills and also helped me realize that I can learn any computer language fairly quickly. Thank you for taking the time to look through my code, I am always trying my hardest to grow and improve my skills and I welcome any and all feedback you may have. You can reach me on LinkedIn, or by email.
